Class Project Retrospective
=====================================

## What went well (about last sprint)? 
Our team got things done fairly early, especially compared to the sprint before (where we started Thursday instead of Tuesday). We got our website deployed early, tested for bugs early, and everything was working as should. The whole sprint was a smooth process, as we were quick to assign tasks together, and the GitHub workflow went very well, as we dealt with merge conflicts and got practice with the Git workflow. Also, the GitHub Webhook that we enabled on Discord helped a lot by notifying us about any new pushes to remind us to continuously pull the new changes to our local repositories.  
## What could have gone better? 
Overall, we should be keeping up with the videos that Scot posts, and be more aware that Slack posts will be made to change or specify requirements for these milestones/sprints, as well as have a bit clearer requirements (both on the student and professors ends; last sprint was kind of hectic, so we think everyone should work on that). We should also put more clear descriptions and avoid doing BRUF during the inception phase. We also kept getting roslyn errors, and Azure took a while to set up with two databases, but we learned from those errors.
## Some specific recommendations to the process or for the process for the next sprint? 
We should add more point totals and estimate better, as some of ours were not the right points (some were clearly worth more than we had estimated). We undersold ourselves a little bit for the last sprint. 
## Are there things that need to be brought up outside the team? 
We already discussed this with our professors; mainly just last weekâ€™s instructions.
