Simply Seniors Project
The project that the Bit Breakers team has decided to tackle for their senior capstone is the creation of the Simply Seniors web service. This project is to allow seniors to communicate with each other in a convenient way, as our family members are getting to a point in their life in which technology is becoming difficult or cumbersome to try to use. The problem is that social sites are populated with people who don't have the same concerns or requirements. They want a place to go for 65+ (only) people that has a simple clean UI that is comprehensive. This should help seniors find people and services that are useful to them in an easy to use environment. The goal is to be a place that seniors would want to communicate without all the background noise that consistently populates other social media platforms.  

Vision Statement
For seniors (those who are 65+) who need a convenient, easy way to socialize and find activities, the Simply Seniors website is an information system that will provide a single, convenient point of access for seniors to find people and services near them. This includes information about events close to their proximity that may interest them, ways to group up with others with similar interests to join those events, and a convenient, easy to read, use, and navigate platform for seniors. Unlike other social media sites, our product will be very easy to use for seniors with a simple, generic, and convenient layout, as well as have seniors be able to find activities of interest near them, and be able to pair up with others with similar interests.
